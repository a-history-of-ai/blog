This blog is about AI history and the some of the ideas that shaped it. 

I write for those building with AI and those evaluating investments. Engineers choosing approaches. Anyone trying to separate hype from history.
Each post stands alone. Read them in order or pick what interests you.

The past is full of unfinished business. Some of it might be useful.
